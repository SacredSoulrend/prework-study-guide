# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

This project showed me the basics on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  It inspires me to learn more about coding and the potential that coding has in our everyday lives.
